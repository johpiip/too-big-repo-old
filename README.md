A repository to test splitting

I am testing how to split 'scripts' out of this repo to its own repo: https://help.github.com/articles/splitting-a-subfolder-out-into-a-new-repository/

Now, scripts are splitted to another repo.

Let's just modify this file a bit so we have a new commit ready.

But suddenly, I start adding stuff for my new branch! No one saw that coming!

Branches are super beautiful things! Very very beautiful things!

How does this verification work? What about now? Too difficult!
